I read the article on Forbes the other day about how [Zuckerberg is now
richer than Jobs][]. The line where the author says, “While the new
wealth rankings mean little more than Silicon Valley bragging rights”
made me think does wealth really give someone bragging rights in Silicon
Valley? To me the culture here rewards innovation not wealth. I would
say bragging rights would be given to people who create and innovate new
technologies and fields. Therefore, I decided to create a top 10 list of
people I think would have bragging rights in Silicon Valley and a list
of up and comers. Let me know in the comments if you agree and if you
would take out some people and add in others.

Top 10 people with bragging rights in Silicon Valley:

1.  Steve Wozniak
2.  Vinton Cerf
3.  Steve Jobs
4.  Sergey Brin
5.  Larry Page
6.  Paul Buchheit
7.  Max Levchin
8.  Larry Ellison
9.  Craig Newmark
10. George Lucas

Top 10 up and comers:

1.  Jack Dorsey
2.  Evan Williams
3.  Mark Zuckerberg
4.  Chris Wanstrath
5.  Tom Preston-Werner
6.  Dennis Crowley
7.  Matt Mullenweg
8.  David Weekly
9.  Kevin Rose
10. Justin Kan
