A few days ago I was introduced to a cool new ruby gem called cheat by
my roommate [Rob][]. The ruby [cheat gem][] is an amazing tool to have
with you whenever you are programming. Before this gem I would download
pdfs cheat sheets for ruby on rails, vim and regular expressions. With
this gem I have access to over 548 and growing number of cheat sheets
all through the easy access of my mac terminal.

All you have to do is simply type `cheat vim` and you will get a list of
all the cheats for vim. However, a problem I had was that the list was
so long and it was a pain to scroll through the terminal. The best way
to solve that problem is to write your command with the less command so
it would be `cheat vim | less`. All of the cheat sheets are user created
on the website for the cheat gem. There are cheats for a ton of things
ranging from ruby on rails, css and some interesting easter eggs as
well. When you download the gem try typing `cheat girlfriend` or
`cheat coding`.

I would have to say this is one of the most useful gems I have installed
on my computer. Other gems have helped out a lot with projects, but this
one I will be using a lot because it has cheat sheets for such a large
range of things that I will be using in many future projects. I would
definitely say for any ruby on rails programming the cheat gem should be
one of the first gems that you install on your computer.
